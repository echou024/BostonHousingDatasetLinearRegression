# Boston Housing Dataset Linear Regression
Implementation of linear regression using direct solution and gradient descent with the Boston housing dataset.
We will first attempt to predict output using a single attribute/feature. Then we will perform linear regression using multiple attributes/features.

The Boston housing data set was collected in the 1970s to study the relationship between house price and various factors such as the house size, crime rate, socio-economic status, etc. The raw data and a complete description of the dataset can be found on the UCI website:
